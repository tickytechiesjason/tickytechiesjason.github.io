                Ah, coffee. Whether you’re cradling a travel mug on your way 
                to work or dashing out after spin class to refuel with a skinny 
                latte, it’s hard to imagine a day without it. The caffeine perks 
                you up, and there’s something incredibly soothing about sipping 
                a steaming cup of joe. But is drinking coffee good for you?

                    Black coffee is simply coffee that is normally brewed without 
                    the addition of additives such as sugar, milk, cream, or added 
                    flavors. While it has a slightly <span>bitter</span> taste compared to when 
                    it is flavored with additives, many people love a strong cup of 
                    black coffee. In fact, for some, it is part of their everyday <span>diet</span>

                    Decaf is short for decaffeinated coffee.
                    It’s coffee from coffee beans that have had at least 97% of their 
                    <span>caffeine</span> removed. There are many ways to remove caffeine from coffee 
                    beans. Most of them include water, organic solvents, or carbon dioxide

                    Espresso (ess-PRESS-oh) is a full-flavored, concentrated form of coffee 
                    that is served in “shots.” It is made by forcing pressurized hot water 
                    through very finely ground coffee beans using an espresso machine. 
                    The result is a liquid stronger than coffee topped with a <span>“crema”</span>, a 
                    brown foam that forms when air bubbles combine with the soluble oils of 
                    fine-ground coffee and sits on top of a properly pulled shot of espresso. 
                    The crema adds to the <span>rich flavor</span> and lingering aftertaste of espresso

                <p class="coffee-info">
                    A latte is a type of coffee drink. It is an espresso-based coffee drink 
                    with steamed milk and foamed milk (microfoam). Other flavorings can be added 
                    to the latte to suit the taste of the drinker. <span>Vanilla</span>, <span>chocolate</span>, and <span>caramel</span> 
                    are all popular variants. The term as used in English is a shortened form of the 
                    Italian caffè e latte, caffelatte or caffellatte, which means <span>“milk coffee”<span>

                <p class="coffee-info">
                    This espresso-based drink is similar to a latte, but the frothy top layer is <span>thicker</span>. 
                    The standard ratio is equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam. 
                    It's often served in a 6-ounce cup (smaller than a latte cup) and can be topped with a sprinkling of <span>cinnamon</span>
